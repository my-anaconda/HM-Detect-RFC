# HM-Detect-RFC
HM-Detect is a novel heart murmur detection and classification/characterization method using techniques in sound feature analysis, signal processing, and machine learning.

In this project, multiple random forest classifier (RFC) models are used to classify the location of a heart murmur among the heart's valves (aortic, pulmonary, mitral, and tricuspid). This method was trained on the CirCor DigiScope Phonocardiogram Database and the Michigan Heart Sound & Murmur Library.

The CirCor Database and Michigan Heart Sound & Murmur Library are available online but are not included in this repository.
